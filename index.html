<h1> My pets </h1>

<ul>

<h2><li> Nacho</li></h2>

	<p> My dog Nacho is a Bichon Frise and Jack Russell Terrier mix. My family adopted him from a rescue home about 6 years ago and he is my best friend and a huge factor as to why I wanted to stay in San Diego. </p>

<h2><li> Biscuit the Tarantula</li></h2>
	<!-- Biscuit Pic -->

	<p> Biscuit is an Arizona Blonde tarantula, also known as <i> Aphonopelma chalcodes</i>. My boyfriend and I have had him for a couple months after deciding we wanted more exotic pets. This is not my first tarantula as I had a Brazilian White Knee sling named Greenie Sr., however someone left his cage open and it seems he escaped so if you're ever at my house and feel some crawling don't worry because he is house trained and friendly. :) </p>

<h1> Pets that I plan to have </h2>

<h2> A Blue-Tongued Skink</h2>
	<!-- Picture of Blue tongue here -->

	<p> Blue-tounged skinks are naturally located in Australia, as well as New Guinea and Indonesia. They are a shy but friendly species and their short legs cause them to be much slower than most lizards. When in danger the skink will display its blue tongue to the predator to startle it and try to escape. 

<h2> A Pumpkin Patch Tarantula </h2>

<p> The Pumpkin Patch tarantula, also known as <i> Hapalopus formosus</i>, is a great beginner tarantula. These tarantulas rarely enter a defensive stance and hardly ever flick their hairs, which is a defense mechanism. They tend to be more skittish and run away instead, that being said they are pretty quick on their feet. They have a weaker venom so if you got bit by one it would not be as bad. The Pumpkin Patch has two types,
a big type, and a small type; the big males can be 2-3 inches, while the females can reach 4 inches. The small type will reach half those sizes. </p>
